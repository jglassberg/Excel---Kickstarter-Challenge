# Kickstarting with Excel

Module 1: Excel 


Overview of Project
	
	Module 1 consisted of reviewing Microsoft Excel and its functionality, specifically by teaching us how to 
enhance our data analysez through different organization stategies (i.e.: filtering, formating & freezing), manipulation through visual 
representations such as pivot tables, pivot charts, as well as distinguishing appropriate charts types. Subsequently, 
the kickerstarter covered descriptive statistics and shows us how the analytical story develops when calculating
the data set's central tendencies. From a comprehensive perspective, this module introduced the class to Excel and 
explained how the software fits into the data lanscape, but most importantly set 
the basis for writing functions and preliminary coding.

Analysis & Challenges

1. Analysis:

	The kickstarter challenged provided a data set for an entertainment series (plays, movies, television shows) and outlined the status of the
program since inceptions while reviewing the regional demographics. Additionally, the data included details regarding the fundraising efforts to see
if the program is reaching their goal. It has been our job to dissect the data to determine if there are any correlations between funraising and the 
programming's outcomes, whether there was a category preference or even an impact on launch date.



2. Challenges:
	
	Being new to excel and getting accquantained with the nuances were a challenge for me. Writing functions is like learning a new language and the
new language contains specific syntax and mulitple arguments. There are instances where the function will not run because the arument has not been included. 
For instances, the COUNTIFS() formula encompassed 3 different criteria and if each argument was not appropriately accounted for the formula would error 
or the calculation would be incorrect. Additionally, that exercise included three different derivatives of the formula: (1) success plays, (2) failed plays and (3) canceled plays
- in hopes to save some time, I dragged and dropped the formula for minimal edits to take place after. However, I did not take into consideration what happens when you do not place
a $ sign before the column and row indicator. Initially I did not make this inclusions and the data being pulled was for the incorrect ranges. This mis-step tripped me up. I was not 
able to find the root cause of the issue and it took me approximately 40 minutes to figure it out. Once I understood the issue and found the resolution I was required to go 
back and revise each cell's forumla to make sure the correct ranges were being included thus converging the correct data for the anaysis. 


3. Results

	Conclusion - Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

	For the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date data it can be concluded that the most successful months are May and June with 111 and 100 shows launched respectfully.
Additionally the data supports that not many shows are canceled - of the total shows (1369) 37 were canceled which makes up 2.7% of all theater productions.Plus there 
was no data provided for October which implies that there is no activity for the theater in October.


	Conclusion - Outcomes based on Goals

	The line graph for Outcomes based on goals supposrt that there are no programs cancelations for this data set and the figures for successful programs and failed programs have
direct impact on one another. The lines are opposite reflections of one another. 

	Limitations & Recommendations

1. Limitations:

	Since the data set covers multiple regions and uses currency as data point it could be difficult to a one-to-one comparison. If you were to look at the money for the United States 
and compare it to Australia, there could additional factors impacting the execution such as, economic status, cost of living, currency, natural disaters, etc. In order to have a true understanding
of the data it would be imperative to do a research to understand each country's economy during the course of the study. the study spans 7 years which leaves a lot of room for change in economic health. 

2. Recommendations:
	
	Different demographics have different responses to different shows and cultural biases associated with. It would be cool to do an analysis on category by country to see which 
subcategories are liked most where and see if that has anything to do with the success and failure rate. This could provide more insight and possibly set larger goals for those programs
in said regions and discontinuing productions for programs that are disliked. More of a curtailing of cultural biases.
